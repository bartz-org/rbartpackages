Print a git rev-list range spec for ASV benchmarking.

The output covers:
1. All version tags on the default branch with commit dates after CUTOFF_DATE
2. The HEAD of the default branch

The output is one space-separated line, prefixed with `--no-walk`, suitable
for passing directly as the positional `range` argument to `asv run`. asv
shlex-splits it and feeds it to `git rev-list --first-parent` — which errors
out on unknown refs, so an unresolvable ref aborts the whole run instead of
being silently skipped (as `asv run HASHFILE:-` does).

The helpers in this module are also used by `check_workarounds.py` to derive
the floor for `rbartpackages` itself (= oldest benchmarked version).
