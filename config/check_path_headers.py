"""Check the `rbartpackages/<path>` comment atop each source file matches its location.

Source files open with a comment line `rbartpackages/<repo-relative-path>` just
above the MIT license header. The comment marker varies by language (`#`, `..`,
`{#`, `/*`, or none inside an HTML comment); only the path is checked. This
catches a header left stale after a file is moved or renamed.

Files without the rbartpackages license header are out of scope and skipped.
Pass the files to check as command-line arguments, as pre-commit does.
